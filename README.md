Conceptual Diagram

a customer can place many orders; an order belongs to exactly one customer.
an order has many order items; each order item refers to exactly one product.
an order can have multiple payments (e.g., split tender: gift card + card).
a shipping address can be reused by many orders (e.g., “home”), and customers can save multiple addresses.
we keep price/discount at the order item.
